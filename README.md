# Population Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing global population data, emphasizing data cleaning, processing, and visualization.

The initial step involved cleaning the dataset by filtering out irrelevant country codes ('INX' and 'PSE') and removing unnecessary columns, ensuring accuracy in the analysis. The average population of each country was calculated, and missing values were filtered out to ensure the dataset was complete.

Two primary visualizations were created: 

1. **Bar Charts** comparing the countries with the highest and lowest populations.
2. **Scatter Plots** showing the relationship between population sizes and country codes.

The analysis revealed that the highest populations were observed in 2022, particularly in densely populated regions like Eastern Asia and Latin America. On the other hand, the lowest populations were recorded in 1960, with countries such as Tuvalu and Nauru having the smallest population sizes.

This study offers valuable insights into global population distributions, highlighting key trends that can guide demographic studies and future planning.
